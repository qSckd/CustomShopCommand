# CustomShopCommand, by Voltrex.

This plugin exists and that’s about the nicest thing that can be said about it LOL
At least this one works.

## The truth..
The compiled JAR contained **a random obfuscated folder**, such as:

```
l/M/x/__v3_
```
Which ended up being a rat.

Ive looked into all of the compiled versions that Voltrex uploaded into Wisp Network and CrystalCore and only HIS plugins have a rat

But then.. we got into a vc showing cracked survival with the plugin and guess what? you modified the plugin 5 hours ago

So you didnt actually lose the source did you?

## Why am i leaking this?

Voltrex decided to leak CrystalCore files, just because "we are using your custom plugins" (this is one of the custom plugins hes talmbout)
So yeah why not just let him look like a clown by showing everyone how he uses aI generated code and skidded plugins.

## Current ver

* Compiles
* Removes backdoor
* Provides full source

Is it good?

Yes, Note that i only fixed this so people could have the full source.

AI is a **tool**, not a developer.
This code proves it.

## Final note

> “Why is this code like this?”

Because Voltrex is a skiddy rat.
It was AI.
It was lazy.
And it was not reviewed.
