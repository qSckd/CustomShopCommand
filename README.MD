# CustomShopCommand, by Voltrex.

This plugin exists and that’s about the nicest thing that can be said about it LOL
At least this one works.

## Why am i leaking this?

Voltrex decided to leak CrystalCore files, just because "we are using your custom plugins" (this is one of the custom plugins hes talmbout)
So yeah why not just let him look like a clown by showing everyone how he uses aI generated code and skidded plugins.

## Why this plugin is cheeks
The compiled JAR contained **a random obfuscated folder**, such as:

```
l/M/x/__v3_
```
It does..
* **nothing**
* Provides **zero protection**
* Break compilation if copied incorrectly
* Look like malware to anyone with a brain

ts is crazy because on all of Voltrex´s skidded plugins, this obfuscation is present.

This plugin is a perfect example of what happens when AI generates code

AI is a **tool**, not a developer.
This code proves it.

## Current ver

* Compiles
* Removes fake obfuscation
* Provides full source

Is it good?

Yes, Note that i only fixed this so people could have the full source.

## Final note

> “Why is this code like this?”

Because Voltrex is a skiddy rat.
It was AI.
It was lazy.
And it was not reviewed.
